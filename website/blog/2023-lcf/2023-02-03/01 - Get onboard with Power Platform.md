## Get onboard with Power Platform!

I'm excited to announce that now you can create up to 3 developer environments with the Power Apps Developer Plan! Let's take this opportunity to review how to get a free environment to get started.

## Sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan

The Power Apps Developer Plan gives you a free development environment to build and test with Power Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft Dataverse.
It just takes a few minutes to get a developer environment for Power Platform:

1. Ensure that you have a work account. If you don't, you can [create a test tenant first.](#do-i-need-a-test-tenant)
2. Sign up on the [Power Apps Developer Plan website](https://aka.ms/lowcode-february/devplan).
3. Once the sign up is complete, you will be redirected to your new developer environment.

### Do I need a test tenant?

In an ideal world you would use your existing work account to sign up for the Power Apps Developer Plan. If you already have an Azure account, you likely can use the same account to sign up. If this is not possible for any reason, you can create a free test tenant using the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/developer/create-developer-environment#how-to-create-a-test-tenant).

## Get familiar with the tools

After the sign up you will be in the [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com) and your environment will be ready to use. You can start creating your first Power App.

If you would like to create more environments or manage your environment, visit the [Power Platform Administrator Center.](https://aka.ms/ppac)

If you are a code first developer, you can use the Power Platform CLI to manage your environments, create code first components and much more. The best way to get our CLI is to download the [Visual Studio Code extension.](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction)

## What's next?

Are you a code first developer? To understand how Power Platform can make you more productive and how you can use code to extend the platform, check the [Introduction to Microsoft Power Platform for developers](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/developer/get-started).
